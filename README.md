Based on the analysis, decision trees are a suitable model for predicting temperature values, effectively capturing the non-linear relationships between the variables and providing accurate predictions. Their ability to handle complex interactions and robustness to outliers make decision trees a reliable choice for temperature prediction, enabling informed decisions to be made in various applications such as climate modeling and weather forecasting.
